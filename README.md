# Tempus
Tempus is a tool for the adjustment of block-based schedules on the
fly. Blocks are given a level of elasticity by which the algorithm
will determine the appropriate distribution of changes.

Currently, blocks maintain only the idea of length and elasticity;
however, they will be expanded upon to render time ranges of each
block. Additionally, the ability to provide an initial condition,
insert blocks, et al. will need to be added. In its initial state,
this is at best a proof of concept.
