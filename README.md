# Tempus
Tempus is a tool for the adjustment of block-based schedules on the
fly. Blocks are specified as either elastic or static, so that the 
algorithm will determine the appropriate distribution of changes.

Currently, blocks maintain only the idea of length and elasticity;
however, they will be expanded upon to render time ranges of each
block. Additionally, the ability to provide an initial condition,
insert blocks, et al. will need to be added.
